    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a hit for football Sundays. For a thicker stuffing, drain ricotta overnight. Serve with ranch and blue cheese dressing for dipping.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground chicken</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup Frank's RedHot</li>
            <li>1 (16 oz) container whipped ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 (16 oz) package jumbo pasta shells</li>
            <li>1 (8 oz) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground chicken in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in the skillet with the cooked chicken. Stir cayenne pepper sauce into the chicken mixture and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Squeeze as much moisture from the ricotta cheese using a cheese cloth or paper towels; put drained cheese in a large bowl. Add chicken mixture to the cheese and stir. Refrigerate until completely chilled, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta shells in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain. Rinse with cold water until no longer hot; drain.</li>
            <li>Spoon chicken mixture into cooked pasta shells and arrange into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend over the stuffed shells; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is slightly melted and the stuffing is hot in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
